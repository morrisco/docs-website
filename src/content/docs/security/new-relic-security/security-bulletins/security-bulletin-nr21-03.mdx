## Vulnerability information [#vuln-info]

A high level vulnerability was publicly disclosed for the log4j framework on 2021-12-09. An attacker is able to execute arbitrary code using log messages or log message parameters. We have updated the New Relic Java agent to use a remediated version 2.15.0 of the Apache log4j 2 logging framework. Due to the vulnerability in the log4j logging framework in versions 2.0 to 2.14.1 customers are encouraged to immediately update their agent versions to either 6.5.1 or 7.4.1.

Separately, customers that are using affected versions of the log4j framework (versions 2.0 to 2.14.1) directly in their applications are also encouraged to upgrade log4j to 2.15.0 to remediate this issue for their application.

Upgrading your New Relic Java Agent will not remediate this issue for your application itself, if you use affected versions of log4j.

## Workarounds [#workarounds]

If you are unable to upgrade either your Java agent or log4j2 version, you should consider using the [LunaSec's publicly-available workaround](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) of setting the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` system property in your application startup command. See also the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) for additional advisories, solutions, and tools.
